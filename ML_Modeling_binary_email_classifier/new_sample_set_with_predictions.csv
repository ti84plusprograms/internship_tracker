So, where will you be in the Spring 2025 semester? You can elaborate as necessary. * I will be a full-time student on the campus of Georgia Tech Essay Questions We suggest answering each essay question with around 150-250 words. 1. Tell us why you want to join the Ramblin’ Reck Club! Reck Club prides itself on having members who are excited about different aspects of the club. Some examples include athletic events, opportunities for leadership, Homecoming events, joining a family, interacting with the Reck, and spreading traditions. What facet(s) are you most excited for and why? * Joining the Ramblin’ Reck Club excites me because of the vibrant social atmosphere, opportunities to show school spirit, and the chance to be deeply involved in Georgia Tech traditions. I love the energy that sporting events bring and would be thrilled to contribute to that enthusiasm while representing Tech with pride. I have been to very few games, so getting to join Reck Club would encourage me to spend time at sporting events. The idea of organizing and participating in dynamic campus events through Reck Club is also incredibly appealing, as it offers me a way to make meaningful connections with students while spreading positivity across the campus. Beyond the events, I am drawn to the club’s strong sense of family and camaraderie. The members I’ve met are kind, welcoming, and passionate, and I can see myself thriving in that supportive environment, because I embody the same traits. The opportunity to help maintain and share those traditions while building lifelong friendships is one of the key reasons I want to join. Finally, the reck is an embodiment of travel opportunity, enjoyment and social interaction, all of which I think are super beneficial for the student population at Tech. Again being a reason I want to impact people with. 2. Our club's mission is to promote traditions and spirit on campus, and we are always working to encourage students from different backgrounds to participate. You have been given the opportunity to take on an initiative with the necessary funding and resources from Reck Club (including the Reck). This could include creating a new event, improving on an event Reck Club already does, or partnering with another campus organization. Given our club’s goals, how do you carry out this initiative? * If given the opportunity to spearhead an initiative through Reck Club, I would collaborate with India Club or another Indian organization to host a mock Indian wedding. This event would celebrate Indian culture while fostering inclusivity and joy for the entire Georgia Tech community. Indian weddings are known for their grandeur, vibrant traditions, and sense of togetherness, making them the perfect platform to promote cultural understanding and school spirit. The event would span two days. On the first day, we would host a ""Haldi Showdown"" at Tech Green, a lively competition between the groom’s and bride’s sides involving party games and traditional haldi (turmeric) smearing on the groom or bride—a joyous custom in Indian weddings. On the second day, we would feature a grand baraat (wedding procession) where participants would dance their way from Frat Row to Tech Green, accompanied by dhol players and the Reck carrying the groom and bride. The ceremony would conclude with a beautiful wedding celebration where the significance of the event and its cultural roots would be shared. To enhance the authenticity of the experience, we would cater traditional Indian food, including both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. The second day would feature an elaborate feast reflecting the variety typical of Indian weddings. To ensure sustainability, any excess food would be donated to Klemis Kitchen, involving volunteers to help with the distribution. This initiative would not only showcase the beauty of Indian culture but also create a memorable and joyful experience for participants from all backgrounds. Through collaboration, cultural appreciation, and Reck Club's spirited touch, this event would be a shining example of promoting traditions, inclusivity, and unity at Georgia Tech. 3. Reck Club members make up a close-knit family and often spend time together outside of work events and meetings. What do you value in the communities you are a part of, and what qualities will you bring to the relationships you make in Ramblin' Reck Club? * In every community I’m a part of, I deeply value the friendships and the meaningful connections I build. I appreciate learning about the diverse backgrounds and multicultural identities of those around me. Coming from a multicultural background myself, I am never not amazed at all the cultural differences Despite our differences, shared experiences at Tech create a bond where we can relate, support each other, and exchange valuable advice from our unique perspectives. These connections are incredibly fulfilling and motivating. In Ramblin' Reck Club, I would bring qualities that foster a strong sense of community. I pride myself on being loyal and honest, building relationships based on trust and respect. Positivity is central to who I am—I love creating uplifting environments where everyone feels energized and encouraged. I’m also eventful by nature, often suggesting fun activities to help people bond and grow closer. Above all, I prioritize kindness, always being considerate of people’s commitments, time, and individual experiences. I believe these qualities would help strengthen the close-knit family dynamic that defines the Reck Club. 4. Part of being an involved member of Ramblin’ Reck Club is showcasing leadership in various aspects, such as being an Executive Committee Member, Chair, Sub-Chair, or even just as a general member. Describe a time when you demonstrated leadership, whether through formal roles or informal opportunities. How did you motivate others, navigate challenges, and ensure your team or group was successful? How can the skills and experiences you’ve gained as a leader contribute to Reck Club? These experiences can be either from college, high school, or professional settings. * One of my most meaningful leadership experiences was serving as a UTA for Physics at Georgia Tech. Physics is a notoriously challenging subject, and I’ve had my own struggles with it. However, I’ve always been passionate about helping others see STEM the way I do—with curiosity and excitement. I had three labs per week, which was more than the average UTA, and each lab presented unique questions that required me to adapt and come up with multiple solutions on the spot. It wasn’t a repetitive scenario where I knew exactly how each lab would go or had pre-existing answers from prior sessions.Many students initially lacked confidence, but I motivated them by highlighting their progress and encouraging collaboration, which created a supportive and dynamic learning environment. My role quickly evolved from being just an instructor to becoming a mentor. Understanding their struggles allowed me to provide more meaningful help, so I frequently offered support outside of the classroom. Before one major exam, I organized an impromptu review session in a private library room with around 15 students. We worked through problem sets, past exams, and custom questions I had created from a personal question bank. This experience taught me the importance of adaptability, clear communication, and creating a nurturing environment for growth. I will bring these same qualities to Ramblin’ Reck Club, whether it’s through leading events, supporting others as a chair, or simply being an enthusiastic and proactive member. 5. Since its inception in 1930, Reck Club’s mission has been to “spread joy” to the Georgia Tech community. What is your favorite memory of spreading joy or experiencing joy as a Georgia Tech student? If this is your first semester on campus, discuss a time you felt connected to Georgia Tech or your previous institution. * One of my favorite memories of spreading joy at Georgia Tech was celebrating Holi during my freshman year. Holi is the Indian festival of colors, symbolizing love, unity, and the arrival of spring. It’s a vibrant celebration where people joyfully throw colored powder on one another and share laughter and happiness. I feel incredibly fortunate to have formed such loving friendships that early on. That day, I went around smothering color on friends and even strangers, wishing them ""Happy Holi"" and sharing endless laughs. The beauty of the festival is that it breaks down social barriers—approaching someone new isn’t just accepted; it’s encouraged. Seeing the smiles on their faces was worth any shyness I might have felt in a regular, non-holi-playing setting. Me and my friends captured countless pictures that I still look back on fondly, reminded of how joyful and connected I felt. Holi made me appreciate how Georgia Tech fosters a sense of belonging for diverse cultures. It was a moment where I connected not only with others but also with my Indian heritage in a way I hadn’t fully experienced before because I grew up in Colombia. This experience embodies why I enjoy my time at Tech so much—it’s a place where I’ve learned to embrace spontaneity, joy, and community. Celebrating Holi allowed me to spread joy and gratitude to those around me while also embracing a cultural side of myself that I now cherish deeply. Non-Essay Questions Unlike the previous essay questions, this question will not be graded or scored on a rubric. It will only be used to to give more context regarding your involvements! What does your life outside of the classroom look like? Please briefly discuss leadership positions, if applicable, whether they are a formal position you served or an informal role you took on. How do you see Reck Club fitting in your life as a GT student? (Bullet points are okay to answer this question!) * I am currently in the Media team for CSA, which includes attending weekly meetings and making myself available for GBMs to take photos. I am also meant to be present at their larger scale events which happen every semester. I am also part of the Marketing team for CHEFS at Tech, which includes once again taking photos at their events, and really getting the word out there about there events through social media. I am also a mentor through a peer-mentorship program where I got paired with someone to give them advice on how to handle life at GT, since they are a transfer. I see myself attending as many events for Reck club and really making the time to getting to know the people. I am also looking forward to studying with them, and basically create a new social group setting where I can be celebrated for my enthusiasm because everyone feels the same way. Unlike all previous questions, this response is completely optional and just for fun! It will not be graded or scored in any way. Write a poem about your favorite Tech tradition in under 100 words. All forms of poetry are accepted. For examples of traditions, please refer to this list . Closing Questions Thanks for taking the time to fill out this application!

💡 3 things i wish i knew before applying to 150+ jobs,"3 things I wish I knew before applying to 150 jobs Applicants often apply to 75+ jobs before getting hired. Here's how to stand out! 3 things I wish I knew before applying to 150 jobs Hi Aaryaman, I'm Michael, one of the founders of Simplify. When I was looking for my first job, I applied to over 150 companies . It was painful – so I built Simplify to make that process easier. Reflecting on my journey as a job-seeker and founder, here are my three best tips on how to get ahead in your job search! Tip #1 Make SURE your resume is ATS-readable. Companies often filter candidates through their ATS, so it's crucial that your resume gets parsed properly. Here's a link to an ATS-friendly resume I use, which you can also access with Simplify's resume builder (which has more templates!). Build Your ATS-Resume Tip #2 Apply to RECENT jobs. Job postings often get thousands of applications - in fact, some companies don't even review later applicants ! Make sure your resume gets seen by applying to newly posted jobs. Pro Tip: you can filter the most recently posted jobs on Simplify's job board! View Recent Jobs Tip #3 Tailor your resume keywords. If you want your resume to stand out, you NEED to include the keywords that the hiring manager is filtering for. Our extension analyzes the job description and shows you the most important keywords to include in your resume for every job. Get the Extension Ready to get hired? Level up your job search today. We can't wait to see you land your dream job :) Get Started! Best, Michael Yan Unsubscribe Questions or concerns? Get in touch with us at support@simplify.jobs . Never miss a beat!

Benchmarking is Bad (5 minute read) Luca Maestri, Apple's former CFO, served for 11 years before stepping down. He strongly opposed using benchmarks and instead emphasized the importance of forming efficient teams. He believed that having the right people is more crucial than having a large workforce.

Thank you for applying to Momentus Technologies,"Greetings Aaryaman, Great news! We have received your job application. At least we think it’s yours. It is possible that someone who thinks very highly of you is forwarding around your resume while pretending to be you. That’s not a bad thing, is it? In any case, this is an automatic email, sent by a mindless robot, to let you know that we're absolutely thrilled that you would be interested in working for Momentus Technologies. We're very honored. Even though this is an automatic email, it's not per the usual, so please read on... First things first -- what to expect? Well, it may take a week or two (or even three or four as our volume of applications have increased) before we have an opportunity to review your application. We promise we will review it carefully. Should we determine that this could be a perfect match, we will reach out for next steps! In the meantime, check us out on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Instagram to get an inside look on the culture at Momentus Technologies.

Interested in Applying for CEISMC Group Leader,"Dear Roxanne Francis, I am writing to express my interest in the CEISMC Group Leader position at Georgia Tech. Currently I am an international, rising 2nd year, computer science student at Georgia Tech. As I was reading the job description, I was convinced this is the perfect job for me. I am super passionate about STEM subjects, and I believe one of the best ways to engage students in these topics is to show them this passion. Additionally, I have experience in looking after children in classroom settings, acting as a role model for them, and leading group projects and activities. During high school, I tutored English to a student from the neighboring sister school. This experience helped me develop leadership and collaborative skills. I also had the opportunity to design interactive activities for a larger group of people, a class, which required time management, efficient communication, and social interaction. I am confident that I have the skills and experience necessary to be successful in this position. I am a hard worker and I am always willing to learn new things. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss my qualifications in more detail. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Aaryaman Agarwal",
