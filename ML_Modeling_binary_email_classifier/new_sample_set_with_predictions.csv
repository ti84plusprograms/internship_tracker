Next steps for your Google application,"Dear Muskan Mahajan, Thanks again for applying for the role of Software Engineering Intern, BS, Summer 2025 - United States. To help us get to know you, we invite you to complete a Snapshot survey and a coding exercise (see below). Please complete both the Snapshot survey and coding exercise by 11:59pm PT on Oct 21, 2024 . We can only consider your application for this role if both are completed by the deadline. The Snapshot survey and coding exercise questions, along with your responses and solutions, are for your eyes only . Do not forward or share them. Instructions 1. Complete the Snapshot survey : Tell us more about your skills, experience, and work preferences in a ~15-minute survey. 2. Complete the coding exercise : Give us a sense of your coding skills in this 90-minute exercise. You’ll solve two problems using your choice of C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, or Python languages. Here are some important guidelines: Practice first : Get some practice before you start the coding exercise by clicking ""Practice first"" on the welcome page. We highly recommend practicing before starting the actual coding exercise. [Important] In order to access the coding exercise : Your browser needs to be logged into the same email address you were logged into that first time you accessed the coding exercise. Please also try using an incognito window in Chrome or Safari. If you are still experiencing issues, please let us know. Do not code in multiple windows : This could lead to an incorrect submission of your solutions. Be mindful of time : You have 90 minutes to complete two problems. Make sure to set aside enough time; the timer begins as soon as you click ""Start timed exercise."" Use research : Official documentation and standard libraries can help with structure, syntax, and/or diction. Using them is allowed and encouraged. Only submit your own work : We want to learn more about your skills, not someone else’s. Solutions or source code that come from blogs, your friends, coworkers, professors, etc., won't be reviewed. Questions or Issues? Please send an email to assessment-help@google.com, add ""[Scaled Assessment]"" in the subject line of your email, and include your Name Email Address Question or description of the issue and any relevant screenshots Please report technical issues as soon as possible : We can help you with technical problems within 24 hours of starting the coding exercise, but not after. Accommodations We value inclusiveness and understand there are many ways to process information. If you require an accommodation due to a medical condition, disability, or neurodivergence, please send an email to assessment-help@google.com to request a specific accommodation or determine what options may be available. Please also add “[Scaled Assessment]” in the subject line of your email. Let us know your accommodation needs before engaging in or completing the assessment. Accommodations include, but are not limited to: Extra time to complete the assessment Guidance on screen reader resources: Google Accessibility - built in screen reader Browser URL: https://support.google.com/accessibility/answer/7031755?hl=en#zippy=%2Cchoose-text-with-your-cursor Microsoft - Narrator Browser URL: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1 There is no need to provide us with the nature of or reason for your request for accommodations at this time. Any information you do provide us regarding your health is provided with your explicit consent to our using such information to assess your accommodation request. You can withdraw that consent at any time by sending a subsequent email to assessment-help@google.com . Please also add “[Scaled Assessment]” in the subject line of your email. However, if you withdraw consent before we have made an assessment we may not be able to provide you with an accommodation. Confidentiality: The information you provide in an accommodation request will only be reviewed by our global disability partner, EmployAbility, in order to assess and provide you with reasonable accommodations. Google does not require a diagnosis, treatment plan, or Government disability certificate. Thanks! Google Recruiting FAQs: Can I have an extension? To keep our process fair, we ask that everyone complete both the Snapshot survey and coding exercise by the deadline. If you have a scheduling conflict that absolutely can't be moved, let us know as soon as possible by emailing assessment-help@google.com and we're happy to talk through options. How will I know if my code is submitted? After you submit your solutions, you’ll be redirected to a confirmation page that shows how many questions and lines of code you submitted as well as the language your code was submitted in. When will I get feedback about my coding exercise? We’re not able to provide any specific feedback on your coding exercise, but someone from our staffing team will be in touch after we’ve had a chance to review your entire application, including your Snapshot survey and coding exercise. Please note, if you hear from someone before you’ve completed the Snapshot survey and coding exercise, you’ll still need to finish them by the deadline. Are there system/browser requirements to complete the survey and coding exercise? A consistent internet connection is essential for an optimal experience. We recommend testing your internet connection using our Measurement Lab tool to ensure it's stable. Please use the latest version of one of these browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari. Unable to access the coding exercise?

This will not impact your chance of being a Fellow for this year’s conference. * Yes No How did you find out about this opportunity? * ✓ Instagram Facebook Slack LinkedIn Reach-out from WECode Member Friend shared with me Teacher/School Counselor Parent Group RTC Other: What experience do you have in technology (if none, what excites you about learning it)? What are you excited to do with technology in the future? (max 250 words) * My advent into technology was through developing BELA (Bot for English Language Acquisition) - a full-stack language learning chatbot for Hindi-speaking students. I built BELA using Python's NLP libraries, such as NLTK and Transformers. BELA helped 35+ underserved students at an Indian non-profit I worked at improve their English skills through constant communication and fun, bite-sized exercises. The research for this prototype was published in EMNLP 2022, a moment that reinforced my passion for technology for social good. Since then, I’ve been building web projects for my community. One example is ""Affirm,"" a GPT-3.5-based positive affirmations generator I made using Python and Flask. It accepts a user’s grievance as input and generates affirmations to help them cope better. My latest project is Buzz Bazaar, a GT-campus marketplace for second-hand goods. Since its release in May '24, it has helped 30 Yellow Jackets sell 45+ goods, make money and reduce waste. Building Buzz Bazaar taught me the value of iterative-development based on feedback and the skills to market my creation across campus. Finally, in future, I see myself develop solutions to ensure women's safety in Delhi, often dubbed India's ""rape capital."" This project would involve comprehensive research, leveraging the insights of survivors, policymakers, and medical professionals. My goal would be to create an accessible, frugal SOS system tailored for low-connectivity areas, empowering women with a reliable safety net that works within India’s unique socio-economic landscape. Why do you want to be a WECode Tech Fellow? What will you contribute to the Fellowship? (max 250 words) * A sophomore leading an interdisciplinary innovation club at her school, a senior developing an app to promote small businesses, and a junior with a tech-IG following of 25K (wink wink Skylar Basco).These are just some of the amazing women I met at Harvard WECode 2024. I want to be a WECode Tech Fellow so that I can surround myself with the incredible community of women it fosters and urge the women in my network to become a part of it too. As VP External at Georgia Tech's Women @ College of Computing club, I organize recruitment events for our network of over 650 women. Therefore, I know firsthand how impactful access to recruitment and professional development resources can be for young women in tech. Therefore, I’m eager to connect them to this unique opportunity. Finally, the professional perks of being a WECode Fellow — like coffee chats with companies like Notion and Five Rings LLC, and meeting other ambitious fellows across the country — appeal to me too. In terms of contribution, I am keen to join the Professional Development Committee. I’ve liaised with corporate sponsors like Bloomberg, Google, and Millennium in my current role at W@CC. Furthermore, as Event Director for a Women’s History Month panel discussion at ""Startup Exchange"" club, I have moderated discussions featuring senior leaders like Visa’s SWE Director. I’m excited to emulate these at WECode, helping to facilitate impactful discussions and expand the network of mentors and speakers available to the event. If chosen, how will you publicize WECode given the 3 areas above? (max 250 words) * personal social media, digital communities/networks, and local outreach As a tech fellow for Harvard WECode, I would leverage my extensive network and leadership positions to maximize publicity for the conference. For instance, as VP External of Georgia Tech's Women at College of Computing (650+ members) and Director of Events at Startup Exchange (350+ members), I have direct access to a large pool of potential attendees. I would promote WECode through our clubs' communication channels, including dedicated posts on our opportunities board on Slack and announcements during club meetings. My role in these organizations allows me to personally endorse WECode, adding credibility to the promotion. I'd also tap into my network of fellow CS majors - honestly majority of my friends and acquaintances here at Georgia Tech - particularly focusing on ambitious women in tech who are always seeking such opportunities. Beyond campus organizations, I organize regular internship application sprintathons in my campus apartment lounge. These events provide an ideal setting to introduce WECode to a diverse group of motivated students. I would encourage all participants to apply and consider attending the conference. Lastly, I'd utilize my LinkedIn network of 1800+ followers to spread the word about WECode, reaching a broader audience of tech enthusiasts and potential attendees beyond my immediate campus community. List specific communities/platforms, if any, that you are a part of, to which you can share WECode. * e.g. coding camps, Slack groups, Facebook groups, women in tech accounts, etc. Director of Events at Startup Exchange Georgia Tech, VP External at Women at College of Computing (W@CC) at GT, Member of Girls who code, Member of SWE Social media handle(s) * Please list the handle and the according social media app muskan_mjn (my IG), waccgt (w@cc's IG), startupexchangegt (SX GT) Link(s) to resume, LinkedIn, personal websites or portfolios, anything cool really :) optional!

Complete Your Netflix Software Engineering Internship Application | Next Steps,"Hi Muskan , Thank you for your interest in our Netflix Software Engineering Internship role! In order for your application to be reviewed, please complete this Airtable form . Your application will only be considered complete after you submit this form in conjunction with the application you already submitted on our Netflix Careers site. Please only complete the form once; duplicate submissions will not be considered. Due to the large volume of applications we receive, we're sorry that we're unable to personally follow up with each applicant. Our full recruiting process may take several weeks, so we kindly ask for your patience as we complete candidate reviews and interviews. In order to maintain a fair and equitable hiring process, we will not be able to accommodate very tight deadlines. For applicants selected to proceed, the interview process will begin with a CodeSignal Assessment. The results from this assessment will be used as just one additional data point to determine who will be invited to the interview rounds. The first two rounds of interviews are technical/coding interviews with Netflix software engineers, and the final round consists of both technical and behavioral questions. Your advancement will be based on the feedback at each round. Important Note: If you're selected to move forward, the next email you receive will come from CodeSignal; we strongly recommend adding no-reply@codesignal.com to your contacts to prevent spam filtering. Our goal is to reach out to candidates who are chosen for initial next steps within the next two to three weeks. If you haven’t heard from us by then, we may have reached interview capacity. Note that our Software Engineering intern interview process is designed to assess your generalist skills, coding fundamentals, and aptitude. Offers will be extended to join our 2025 Intern class at Netflix, where we’ll have 3 start date options in Summer 2025 to centralize onboarding programming and training.

Subscribe here for more Applying for a specific role? Ask yourself these 5 questions first: Kareem Abukhadra Sep 15 READ IN APP 1) Is the role actively being hired for? You want to find roles and titles that are actively being hired for, a lot. The more jobs available, the more you can apply to. And that means you can land more interviews, receive more offers, and have more freedom. 2) Do the role's responsibilities align with my past experience? Your past experience and expertise should lend themselves to the responsibilities of the role you’re applying for. Although they may not line up completely, a correlation is needed. 3) Can I tailor my resume to display my competence for the role? This is the key to landing multiple offers. You want to write your resume to make it line up with the responsibilities of the role you’re applying for. Again, although they may not line up completely, it’s important to cater past experiences (without lying or embellishing) to include the parts most relevant to the recruiter or hiring manager. 4) Are the role's responsibilities uniform across companies? This point is key to landing multiple offers. It’ll let you apply to each job with the same resume, and increase efficiency in the application process — while improving your chances of landing multiple interviews. 5) Does the role allow me to drive quantifiable value for the company? When you’re able to drive (and communicate that you can drive) quantifiable value for a company, your leverage in negotiation increases exponentially. Companies don’t hire out of the goodness of their heart. They hire to solve a problem, or make more money. Communicating that you accomplish one or both of those missions for them, and putting a number on it is crucial. As a general rule of thumb, you want to ask for ~20% of the value you’ll drive. But, as always, that number changes with leverage. Check out this post for more info on how to accomplish this. The point is this… Your answer needs to be ""yes"" to all of these questions. This'll let you apply to multiple jobs, land multiple interviews, and negotiate with higher leverage. Any questions? Reply with them!

Application for Consumer/Retail Analyst Role - Mehak Mahajan (Updated CV),"Dear Sir/Madam, I am a first-year BSc Economics student at King's College London, and I would like to express my interest in obtaining a place as a Consumer/Retail Analyst at ODT Capital. My decision to apply for this role stems from my passion for investment and my aim to use my research skills to develop investment recommendations for a student-led investment fund. To develop the fundamentals of finance in high school, I undertook a virtual training programme by the Indian Business School, namely ‘Trading Basics’, through which I learnt how to analyse the corporate financial statements of a company to conduct its fundamental analysis. I completed a 1-month accounting and financial planning internship to apply this knowledge practically. Here, I prepared the ratio analysis reports of 4 major fast-moving consumer goods companies, enhancing my analytical skills. I also understood how to prepare a client’s financial plan based on their financial goals, risk appetite and financial position. At university, I participated in a trading simulation, where I built an ESG portfolio that beat the S&P500 index by 25%. During the spring break, I will complete the 12-week Investment Insight Programme at the Girls Are Investors Organisation to develop my investment skills further. I am also currently preparing for the CFA Level 1 exam. I believe that my team-building skills, communication and research competency, and ability to lead initiatives will add value to the team at ODT Capital: 1. Team player: Volunteering as an Events Associate at the King's College in London Women in Business Society and a Leadership Trainer at Girls in Charge has enabled me to work as a team player and leader. I have also previously been chosen to attend Harvard University's competitive Youth Lead Change programme, where I led a team of 5 students to pitch a hypothetical social initiative on sustainable farming. 2. Communication: Leading pro-bono projects at King's Junior Consulting Group has aided my ability to follow up with my team and the client, ensuring their needs are met. Previously, I have also represented my school at various MUNs, Youth Parliaments, debate platforms, and the ‘World Scholar Cup’, where my team was chosen for the global round in Singapore. 3. Research and Writing: My interest in research and writing has led me to opportunities like working at the Sri Ram College of Commerce for their elite Research Writing Programme, writing articles as an incoming Junior Writer at King's Business review and even starting my blog, Money Mind Media, where I conduct research and publish reports on topics of socio-economic and financial importance. 4. Entrepreneurship: I have also served as the Founder and President of my school's Business Club, the first-ever student club of my school, where I single-handedly built a team of 10 students and a membership of 70+ students. Some of our events: SVIS Business Conclave (150+ participants; distributed prices worth INR 10K), Webinar on Financial Literacy for Teens (60+ students), Walk-a-Thon Fundraiser (INR 30K raised). I am attaching my CV for your perusal. Again, thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Investment Banking Internship Application - Mehak Mahajan,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am a first-year Economics BSc student at King's College London , and I would like to express my interest in obtaining a place as an Investment Banking Intern at Silver Mile Capital. I aspire to pursue a career in investment banking because I think it is a challenging, fascinating, and fast-growing sector that will enable me to combine my computational and analytical backgrounds while creating a meaningful, tangible impact on other actors in the economy, like small businesses, social enterprises and large corporations. In addition, Investment banking offers a fast-paced environment where there is always something new to learn, new developments that affect your work, and opportunities to interact with diverse clients, interact with bright individuals and gain exposure to high-profile transitions. I am confident that the skills and competencies I have developed throughout my studies and extracurricular activities make me a suitable candidate. As a board member or associate, my involvement in various student societies has enabled me to cultivate my teamwork and leadership skills. I am a Consultant at King's Junior Consulting, an Events Associate at the KCL Women in Business Society and a Leadership Trainer at the nationwide Girls In Charge Initiative. Simultaneously, I have volunteered for organisations like WISH charity and Udayan Care as a Fundraising Volunteer and English Language Tutor , respectively. Since high school, I have always been interested in analysing diverse financial topics and the critical M&A transactions happening globally. This interest in research and writing has led me to gain opportunities like working at the Sri Ram College of Commerce for their elite research writing programme and even starting my blog, Money Mind Media , where I publish reports on socio-economic and financial importance. Additionally, I have served as the Founder and President of my school's Business Club , the first-ever student club of my school, where I single-handedly built a team of 10 students and a membership of 70+ students . I have also gained practical knowledge and experience in the financial industry by completing two internships in accounting and financial planning and attending financial modelling boot camps, company insight events and virtual training programmes. Participating in these activities has enabled me to stay organised, manage my time, think constructively and communicate my ideas effectively. My interest in Silver Mile Capital stems from the fact that it is a specialised investment bank and the company's culture and values. After researching the company, I found out that Silver Mile puts a strong emphasis on offering employees a supportive environment where they can challenge themselves to tackle complex financial problems and make a meaningful impact. I am sure that an internship at Silver Mile Capital will offer me an excellent opportunity to gain invaluable knowledge of how investment banking operates, as well as the chance to apply my knowledge in practice and add more pieces to the puzzle of my understanding of this fascinating field. In addition, experiencing the work and culture of the company and gaining exposure to business while networking with professionals and students interested in investment banking is a great way to deepen my understanding of the sector. Therefore, I am attaching my CV for your perusal. Thank you for considering my application, and I am excited to hear from you.

"Your college application January to-do list (or, happy new year)","Your college application January to-do list (or, happy new year) It's January, the final 6 months of your senior year. Center kindness. Dear Seniors – Happy New Year! Hopefully you were able to take some time over your school vacation to rest, relax, and recover from what was likely a stressful fall before starting back to school for this final stretch. For some of you, the college application process ended with confetti and an acceptance to your Early Decision school last month. For others, the process goes on as Regular Decision (or Early Decision 2) applications are completed and submitted in the coming days and the long wait of winter begins. There are a few things that are important for you to keep in mind this winter: 1. Trust your process! Recognize and appreciate the depth of the thoughtful and careful work you have been doing all summer and fall. While this time can feel challenging as you wait and feel like your fate is at the mercy of the college admissions offices, trust that you have done your very best work on your applications, that you have created a balanced list of schools, and that this will all work out! 2. Recognize that there is still time This might feel like the opposite of the point I just made. However, as you hear back from your Early Action schools this winter (many EA programs release decisions in late January), know that you can still find some wonderful likely schools to apply to this winter! There are many, many schools out there whose application deadlines might range from January 15th to February 15th (or even later). If you are curious about which schools those might be, first check your Common App deadlines, but also check out this comprehensive list of Late Application Deadlines (from the College Board ). 3. Know that you are not alone This is a moment to be graceful and lean into kindness as your friends and classmates reconcile their hard work on applications with admissions decisions that might or might not be what they had hoped. Now more than ever is the time to “choose kind” in your responses, to pause before you react or respond to a college acceptance celebration Insta post, and to applaud the successes that you see. Remember, it always works out – sometimes it just takes a little longer and goes on a slightly different path than you had planned. For more on this, check out this excellent blog post from the Georgia Tech Admissions Office (“ Applying to College is Not Like the Movies ”). 4. You only get one senior year! Seize this moment! You have about six months left in a high school career that has certainly not been the one you imagined at the beginning of 9th grade. COVID disruptions, Zoom school, socially distant proms, and canceled athletic seasons have all disrupted high school in different ways. In these last few months, seize opportunities to celebrate and make the most of this time you have left. Your high school class will never be together, fully, in this way again. Take opportunities to celebrate, be goofy, and enjoy this time together. 5. For the adults in your life, reflect on how you want to react to your child's admissions decisions Alas, it's behind a paywall, but if you have the opportunity to read this wonderful piece from Forbes “ Handling College Admissions Decisions: A Sidecar Parent’s Guide, ” Brennan Barnard offers some excellent (and timely) advice on how adults can and should respond as admissions decisions come in. That’s all for now! I’ll be back on April 1 with some more information about how to interpret and respond to the decisions that you have received (including information about managing the Waitlist).

"Your college application December to-do list (so, here we are at last)","Your college application December to-do list (so, here we are at last) It's December. Either you'll be done soon or you'll keep chugging. Chin up. Center kindness. Hello there, Well, here we are! For some of you, December marks the official end of your months of research and hard work as an admission to an Early Decision school comes around. For others, December is just another month in a thoughtful and purposeful process. It is important this month to keep your chin up. As you hear about acceptances from classmates and peers, help them to celebrate even if you are processing a deferral or a rejection yourself. Remember, there are a lot of factors that go into a college application and decision. It is impossible to know why one classmate was admitted and another rejected. Please don’t make uninformed snap judgements about your peers. Remember back in August when we centered kindness? December is a wonderful time to resurface that emotion. If your college application process is continuing, here are some important tasks to complete in December: 1. Finish the supplements For many schools, January 1 is the deadline for all regular decision applications. If you are relying on the feedback of a teacher to support your writing, it is essential that you provide drafts to that teacher for comments well in advance of the winter school holiday. It is not fair to ask a teacher (or college counselor) to read and edit a supplement essay for you between Christmas and New Year. 2. Update your Common Application? You are allowed to make any edits or changes to your Common Application between submitting it in November and submitting it again to new schools in January. Do you have fall test scores to add? Have you changed your schedule? Do you have a new favorite activity? Take the time now to make sure that your Common Application is the best reflection of you that it possibly can be. 3. Consider Additional Information On the “Writing” page of your Common App, you should notice additional, optional spaces to include more writing. Here, you have the opportunity in a very open-ended way to share more information with the schools on your list. Remember, whatever you add here will be shared with all of the schools you apply to, so do not make this a statement that is specific to any one college. That said, you have 650 additional words to support or advocate for yourself. Do you have another essay you would like to share? Does it say something meaningfully different from your main essay? Take your time to consider what, if anything, you might want to include in the Additional Information section. 4. Manage Financial Aid applications Working with your family, be sure that you are ready to submit your FAFSA and, if needed, your CSS Profile and school-specific financial aid forms to the regular decision schools on your list. Some schools might send you additional financial aid paperwork (something like a “Federal Verification Form”) or ask you to submit a “Tax Transcript” in addition to your other paperwork. Follow the steps they indicate. If you have questions, remember that Financial Aid officers are people too, and you can always call them to make an appointment to talk this through. The FAFSA allows you to submit to only 10 schools at a time. If you have more than 10 schools on your RD list, do not worry! Submit your FAFSA to the first 10 schools. Wait 3-5 business days. Log back into your FAFSA and delete those schools (it has been sent to them now) and add the rest of your list. 5. Don’t forget a “Thank You” Your teachers worked hard to write thoughtful letters to support your college application process. Please take time in December to hand write them a thank you note. Be specific and gracious. If you feel comfortable doing so, keep them updated and in the loop as your decisions come out. At a minimum, please let them know where you are planning to matriculate! They care about you and about your success. Yes, this is a busy time, but know that you have got this! All of the careful work you have done already this year will make many of these tasks easy to complete. If you would like additional support on any of the above, please schedule a meeting with a member of the Cambridge Coaching team here . We love to make this process more manageable for students like you. All the best, Elise Elise London Elise spent fourteen years working as a high school college counselor in highly selective independent schools.
