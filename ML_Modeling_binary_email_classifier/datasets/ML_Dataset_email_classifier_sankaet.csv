We are looking into the 4x4 Peachtree units. We started the application several weeks ago but could not complete it because of the restrictions of your guarantor program. Being international students, it was hard for us to find a guarantor and complete that section of the application. Now that we have all the details, we are ready to fill out the application. However, we now see no longer see the $1355 price tag on the application portal. Instead it lists $1425. We have been on several calls with the leasing office and they let us know that the official price is still $1355 (as listed on your website as well). We’d appreciate if you could help us completing the application and keeping the $1355 price for the Peachtree. We’re still really interested in the Mark apartments and would love to complete the application at the earliest. Thanks, Rahul +1 (470)461-4339 [This email was sent from an EXTERNAL SOURCE.
