"Yoomin - [Google APM] Follow-up to your APM, University Graduate Application","Hi Yoomin , Thanks for your interest in Google! We received your application for the Associate Product Manager, University Graduate role and would like to move forward. The first step is to complete a 45 minute preliminary screen with a Product Manager that will assess Product Insight, Strategic Insight & Analytical skills. Please review the next steps below to proceed: Schedule your first interview: O ur scheduling team ( google-interview-scheduling-team@google.com ) will be reaching out to collect your availability via a candidate portal. We understand that your schedule may not be able to accommodate the requested interview window. You’re able to provide availability outside of the requested window. Please check your spam folder if you haven’t heard from them within 48 business hours. Note: We hire on a rolling basis and would recommend you interview as soon as you’re available and feel prepared. Prepare for your interview: Review our attached APM Prep Guide. Review g.co/APM , the APM program site, along with the great program-specific content on the Google Students YouTube channel : Life of an APM: Meet a Google APM Alumni APM Program Overview APM YouTube Live: Recorded APM Prep Session Meet Product Managers at Google Google Resume Tips and Advice Review the important reminders at the end of this email What happens afterwards? Once your interview is completed, I’ll work on collecting your feedback (in some cases, this can take up to a week) and provide you with an email update. If successful at this interview stage, we’ll proceed with 3 more Google Meet interviews and a written assignment. The second round of interviews will cover the skills described in our APM Hiring Process video linked above and you’ll have the opportunity to connect with a recruiter before interviewing. Some Important Reminders: Given the strong interest we have seen in our APM internship, the expected duration of our hiring process will be approximately 8-12 weeks from your preliminary screen to the final offer. If you do have a confirmed offer deadline within that time frame, I would recommend reaching out to your recruiter with that company as early as possible to see if there is any possibility to get an extension so that you are able to fully explore your interest within Google! On my end, I will do my very best to ensure our process moves as quickly as possible. To provide you with as much flexibility as possible, we are offering a hybrid work model which may vary across roles and regions. Like most Googlers, this option means spending approximately three days in the office and two days wherever you work best. Participation in the internship program requires that you are located in the country to which you’ve applied for the duration of the internship program. If you’re located outside of the country and are unsure regarding work authorization, please mention this to your recruiter. Please be advised that if you are not able to be located in the country to which you’ve applied (either from the inability to obtain work authorization or the inability to travel/relocate), unfortunately, we will not be able to move forward with you as a candidate for the internship program.

Complete Your Netflix New Grad Application | Next Steps,"Hi Yoomin , Thank you for your interest in our Netflix New Grad Software Engineer (2025) role! In order for your application to be reviewed, please complete this Airtable form . Your application will only be considered complete after you submit this form in conjunction with the application you already submitted on our Netflix Careers site. Please only complete the form once; duplicate submissions will not be considered. Due to the large volume of applications we receive, we're sorry that we're unable to personally follow up with each applicant. Our full recruiting process may take several weeks, so we kindly ask for your patience as we complete candidate reviews and interviews. In order to maintain a fair and equitable hiring process, we will not be able to accommodate very tight deadlines. For applicants selected to proceed, the interview process will begin with a CodeSignal pre-screen assessment based on the General Coding Framework. The results from this assessment will be used as just one additional data point to determine who will be invited to the interview rounds. The first round is a technical/coding interview with a software engineer, and then the final round consists of 3 interviews in a 3-hour block (1 problem-solving, 1 system design, 1 behavioral). Your advancement will be based on the feedback at each round. If you're selected to move forward, the next email you receive will come from CodeSignal; we strongly recommend adding no-reply@codesignal.com to your contacts to prevent spam filtering. Our goal is to reach out to candidates who are chosen for initial next steps within the next two to four weeks. If you haven’t heard from us by then, we may have reached interview capacity. Note that our New Grad interview process is designed to assess your generalist software engineering skills, coding fundamentals, and aptitude. Offers will be extended to join our 2025 New Grad class at Netflix, where we’ll have 2 start date options in Summer 2025 to centralize onboarding programming and training.
