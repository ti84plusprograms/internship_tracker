Your responses help us see what kind of community member you will be and just how excited you are about Tufts. If you have more questions that you want answered before the March 18 transfer application deadline , we're hosting a transfer specific Q&A on March 8 at 4pm ET .

Transfer Application Withdrawn Course Explained - Kavya Adusumilli,"Hi Ms. Berlinger, I hope you are doing well. This is Kavya Adusumilli (current Rutgers University student), and I have submitted a transfer application for Fall 2024 to the University of Michigan. I missed adding the details regarding my withdrawn course on the application prior to submission. I called Michigan undergrad admissions, and I was told to reach out to you with my explanation of why I dropped the course. I dropped General Biology 1 because I developed a great interest in other courses that were offered. I wanted to make the most of the other courses that aligned with my interests and future goals better. I am also not pursuing a health sciences track, so I decided to pick courses that are better suited for me. Thank you so much for your time and help, I greatly appreciate it.

With my solid foundation in Python alongside data visualization tools including Tableau and Power BI, and as my learning endeavors with Java, data structures, algorithms further, I believe I am a strong fit for the internship. I am continuing my involvement in the technology community in college as a member of [WiCS], the Women in Computer Science chapter at Rutgers, an empowering space, where I get to discuss with my peers and gain applicable knowledge. I am also involved in the Quantitative Finance Club, and Data Science Club, where I get to employ data in different programs, but with the same goal of clear analysis and creating cutting-edge models, to collaborate and consult to make optimal decisions. I look forward to contributing my technical and collaborative skills to solve complex problems, create exceptional projects, and make a meaningful impact.
