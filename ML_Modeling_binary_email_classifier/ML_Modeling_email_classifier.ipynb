      "Index: 221 Text: Are you ready to apply to Tufts? Dear Kavya, We are often asked by prospective transfer students what stands out in the application process. While there is no magical formula for the perfect transfer application, there are many, many ways to put together a compelling application. Simply put, we are looking for students who are really excited to join our community and make Tufts their home for the remainder of their college experience. Here are suggestions to help you do just that: Make your journey clear! Use your application to help us understand your trajectory and experiences inside and outside the classroom during high school and college. Reflect on what you've learned about yourself since you first went through the college search process. Use this self-awareness to explain your goals, interests, and reasons for transferring, especially within the personal statement. Don't lose sight of the Tufts short-answer questions or leave them until the last minute. Your responses help us see what kind of community member you will be and just how excited you are about Tufts. If you have more questions that you want answered before the March 18 transfer application deadline , we're hosting a transfer specific Q&A on March 8 at 4pm ET .

I'm interested in the AI/ML internship, and believe my previous experience makes me a good fit for this role. During high school, I did an Independent Study in Machine Learning, exploring techniques including regression, decision trees, clustering, KNN, and neural networks.

With my solid foundation in Python alongside data visualization tools including Tableau and Power BI, and as my learning endeavors with Java, data structures, algorithms further, I believe I am a strong fit for the internship. I am continuing my involvement in the technology community in college as a member of [WiCS], the Women in Computer Science chapter at Rutgers, an empowering space, where I get to discuss with my peers and gain applicable knowledge. I am also involved in the Quantitative Finance Club, and Data Science Club, where I get to employ data in different programs, but with the same goal of clear analysis and creating cutting-edge models, to collaborate and consult to make optimal decisions. I look forward to contributing my technical and collaborative skills to solve complex problems, create exceptional projects, and make a meaningful impact.

We’ve had a team of dedicated students writing throughout the semester, so check out their stories on the Jumbo Talk blogs . Dream up your ideal class schedule by checking out our majors and minors . We recommend you read up on professors and their incredible projects, explore descriptions of classes, and learn how all of your interests can come together at Tufts. In the fall, we ran a month of Fall for Tufts programs, many of which are recorded. There, (re)watch info sessions, student panels, and conversations with campus partners. Tip #3: Visualize yourself on campus We developed a lot of content for you to see yourself on the Hill. Watch student takeovers from this fall through our IG highlights, and get the feel of our residence halls by watching our Home @ Tufts videos . “Visit” Tufts in vibrant color through our virtual tour , led by current students, to give you insight into campus. Tip #4: Write your “Why Tufts?” We've compiled a blog with our best tips on hitting your short-answer questions out of the proverbial park . Our students answer \"Why Tufts?\" in this short video to give you some inspiration.

In case you haven't had the chance to see it, I encourage you to review our most recent USC Viterbi Viewbook to learn more about the opportunities waiting for you at USC Viterbi. Our comprehensive admission file review process takes a considerable amount of time. The Viterbi School Admission Staff will be working closely with the USC Office of Admission in reviewing complete applications. Be sure to watch your email throughout the next few months. The university will contact you if information is missing, incomplete, or new info is needed. You may also login to your USC applicant portal at https://applyto.usc.edu/status for more information, or to upload additional info. Each complete application will receive admission status updates according to https://admission.usc.edu/apply/dates-deadlines/ . Although not required for admission, we recommend all applicants to complete the need-based financial aid application process. Be sure to start soon as it involves a few steps and may take some time to complete (as well as help from your parents/guardians). All of the necessary forms and instructions are online at financialaid.usc.edu . I wish you and your family continued good health and wellness. I also hope you get to enjoy as much as possible of your last year in high school. If you have any additional questions about our programs or the application process, please call us at (213) 600-9919, or email us at vadmit@usc.edu . We look forward to reviewing your application for Fall 2023. Fight On! Paul Paul D.

I am also involved in the Quantitative Finance Club, and Data Science Club, where I get to employ data in different programs, but with the same goal of clear analysis and creating cutting-edge models, to collaborate and consult to make optimal decisions.

      "231 0.37706347223077674 Hi Ms. Berlinger, I hope you are doing well. This is Kavya Adusumilli (current Rutgers University student), and I have submitted a transfer application for Fall 2024 to the University of Michigan. I missed adding the details regarding my withdrawn course on the application prior to submission. I called Michigan undergrad admissions, and I was told to reach out to you with my explanation of why I dropped the course. I dropped General Biology 1 because I developed a great interest in other courses that were offered. I wanted to make the most of the other courses that aligned with my interests and future goals better. I am also not pursuing a health sciences track, so I decided to pick courses that are better suited for me. Thank you so much for your time and help, I greatly appreciate it.

This is Kavya Adusumilli (current Rutgers University student), and I have submitted a transfer application for Fall 2024 to the University of Michigan. I missed adding the details regarding my withdrawn course on the application prior to submission. I called Michigan undergrad admissions, and I was told to reach out to you with my explanation of why I dropped the course. I dropped General Biology 1 because I developed a great interest in other courses that were offered. I wanted to make the most of the other courses that aligned with my interests and future goals better. I am also not pursuing a health sciences track, so I decided to pick courses that are better suited for me. Thank you so much for your time and help, I greatly appreciate it.

This is Kavya Adusumilli (current Rutgers University student), and I have submitted a transfer application for Fall 2024 to the University of Michigan. I missed adding the details regarding my withdrawn course on the application prior to submission. I called Michigan undergrad admissions, and I was told to reach out to you with my explanation of why I dropped the course. I dropped General Biology 1 because I developed a great interest in other courses that were offered. I wanted to make the most of the other courses that aligned with my interests and future goals better. I am also not pursuing a health sciences track, so I decided to pick courses that are better suited for me. Thank you so much for your time and help, I greatly appreciate it.

There’s Sears think[box], which is essentially an engineers’ playground, and the Cleveland Clinic is right across the road with some of the most advanced medical tech I’ve ever seen.

      "221 0.3020311993036575 Are you ready to apply to Tufts? Dear Kavya, We are often asked by prospective transfer students what stands out in the application process. While there is no magical formula for the perfect transfer application, there are many, many ways to put together a compelling application. Simply put, we are looking for students who are really excited to join our community and make Tufts their home for the remainder of their college experience. Here are suggestions to help you do just that: Make your journey clear! Use your application to help us understand your trajectory and experiences inside and outside the classroom during high school and college. Reflect on what you've learned about yourself since you first went through the college search process. Use this self-awareness to explain your goals, interests, and reasons for transferring, especially within the personal statement. Don't lose sight of the Tufts short-answer questions or leave them until the last minute. Your responses help us see what kind of community member you will be and just how excited you are about Tufts. If you have more questions that you want answered before the March 18 transfer application deadline , we're hosting a transfer specific Q&A on March 8 at 4pm ET . All our best, Tufts Admissions Tufts is a medium-sized research and liberal arts university of 6,600 undergraduate students, located in the greater Boston area.

      "306 0.28688929756990844 Message from University of Southern California Dear Kavya, USC seeks to enroll outstanding students who are involved in their Native American, Alaskan Native or Native Hawaiian community. To assist in this effort, we are pleased to announce a new scholarship program: the USC Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Native Leadership Scholarship (NLS) . As one of USC’s top merit scholarships, the NLS will cover 50 percent of USC tuition for four years. If you think you might be eligible for this scholarship, please complete the NLS application by January 15, 2023 . The application only requires two brief responses that will allow us to learn more about your native identity and involvement in your community. To access the NLS application , you will need to log in using your applicant portal credentials. The Native Leadership Scholarship is not only a source of financial aid, but also one more way USC has committed to strengthening the native communities within our Trojan Family. To learn more about how we have already been supporting native students, we encourage you to check out the Native American Student Assembly , which was formed by University Student Government to help students foster and grow their cultural identities on campus. We are also thrilled to have recently named a campus building after a prominent alumnus and well-known Native American leader.
